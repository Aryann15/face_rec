# face_rec
face recognizer using openCV's built-in recognizer. I used about 20 images of each actors(robert downey jr, chris evans, chris hemsworth, scarlett johnason ,mark ruffalo, jeremy renner) i get the following results ![image](https://github.com/Aryann15/face_rec/assets/82017158/2da4b9be-62ba-457d-bf02-4972cd323f53)

 we saved model in yaml file so as to use it further if required. obviously it has some errors as opencv's built in face recognizer is not the best.
